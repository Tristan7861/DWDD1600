        <h2>The basics</h2>
        <p>Baseball is a <strong>challenging</strong> game and can be dangerous.The main point is to have <em>two teams</em> of at least <strong>9</strong> players. One team is batting and the other is feilding. The batting team has one person up to bat and on person getting ready on the side. The person up to bat waits for the other teams pitcher to throw the ball then <strong><em>WHAM!</em></strong> The batter swings and hits the ball. After they hit the run to 1st base, then to 2nd, then 3rd, then to home to score a point. While this is happening the feilders try to stop them by feilding the ball and trying to tag them or the base to get them out. </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p><Strong>There are 6 infeilders:</Strong></p>
        <p>Catcher, pitcher, first, second, shortstop, and third.</p>
        <p><strong>Then there are 3 outfielders</strong></p>
        <p>Left, center, and right.</p>

        <h2>How it was created...</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Baseball was invented over a long period, drawing influences from English games like cricket and rounders, as well as games of Mayans, Egyptians and the French, according to Encyclopedia Britannica. Many American groups formed their own rules and played their own version of the game through the 1800s.</li>    
            
            <li>The first official baseball game was played in 1846 between the New York Knickerbockers and the New York Nines, a cricket team, using the Knickerbocker Rules, according to Encyclopedia Britannica.</li>
            
            <li>The main reason someone created baseball was because cricket too long of a game and they wanted to finish a game during the length of the persons lunch, so they changed cricket to fill there needs and still have it be different.</li>
